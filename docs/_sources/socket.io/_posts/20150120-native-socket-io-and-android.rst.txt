Native Socket.IO and Android
================================


In this tutorial well learn how to create a chat client that
communicates with a Socket.IO Node.JS chat server, with our native
Android Client! If you want to jump straight to the code, its on GitHub.
Otherwise, read on!

Introduction
------------

To follow along, start by cloning the repository:
socket.io-android-chat.

The app has the following features:

-  Sending a message to all users joining to the room.
-  Notifies when each user joins or leaves.
-  Notifies when an user start typing a message.

Socket.IO provides an event-oriented API that works across all networks,
devices and browsers. Its incredibly robust (works even behind corporate
proxies!) and highly performant, which is very suitable for multiplayer
games or realtime communication.

Installing the Dependencies
---------------------------

The first step is to install the Java Socket.IO client with Gradle.

For this app, we just add the dependency to ``build.gradle``:

.. code:: gradle

   // app/build.gradle
   dependencies {
       ...
       implementation 'com.github.nkzawa:socket.io-client:0.6.0'
   }

We must remember adding the internet permission to
``AndroidManifest.xml``.

.. code:: xml

   <!-- app/AndroidManifest.xml -->
   <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
       <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
       ...
   </manifest>

Now we can use Socket.IO on Android!

Using socket in Activity and Fragment
-------------------------------------

First, we have to initialize a new instance of Socket.IO as follows:

.. code:: java

   import com.github.nkzawa.socketio.client.IO;
   import com.github.nkzawa.socketio.client.Socket;

   private Socket mSocket;
   {
       try {
           mSocket = IO.socket("http://chat.socket.io");
       } catch (URISyntaxException e) {}
   }

   @Override
   public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
       mSocket.connect();
   }

``IO.socket()`` returns a socket for ``http://chat.socket.io`` with the
default options. Notice that the method caches the result, so you can
always get a same ``Socket`` instance for an url from any Activity or
Fragment. And we explicitly call ``connect()`` to establish the
connection here (unlike the JavaScript client). In this app, we use
``onCreate`` lifecycle callback for that, but it actually depends on
your application.

Emitting events
---------------

Sending data looks as follows. In this case, we send a string but you
can do JSON data too with the org.json package, and even binary data is
supported as well!

.. code:: java

   private EditText mInputMessageView;

   private void attemptSend() {
       String message = mInputMessageView.getText().toString().trim();
       if (TextUtils.isEmpty(message)) {
           return;
       }

       mInputMessageView.setText("");
       mSocket.emit("new message", message);
   }

Listening on events
-------------------

Like I mentioned earlier, Socket.IO is **bidirectional**, which means we
can send events to the server, but also at any time during the
communication the server can send events to us.

We then can make the socket listen an event on ``onCreate`` lifecycle
callback.

.. code:: java

   @Override
   public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

       mSocket.on("new message", onNewMessage);
       mSocket.connect();
   }

With this we listen on the ``new message`` event to receive messages
from other users.

.. code:: java

   import com.github.nkzawa.emitter.Emitter;

   private Emitter.Listener onNewMessage = new Emitter.Listener() {
       @Override
       public void call(final Object... args) {
           getActivity().runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
               @Override
               public void run() {
                   JSONObject data = (JSONObject) args[0];
                   String username;
                   String message;
                   try {
                       username = data.getString("username");
                       message = data.getString("message");
                   } catch (JSONException e) {
                       return;
                   }

                   // add the message to view
                   addMessage(username, message);
               }
           });
       }
   };

This is what ``onNewMessage`` looks like. A listener is an instance of
``Emitter.Listener`` and must be implemented the ``call`` method. Youll
notice that inside of ``call()`` is wrapped by
``Activity#runOnUiThread()``, that is because the callback is always
called on another thread from Android UI thread, thus we have to make
sure that adding a message to view happens on the UI thread.

Managing Socket State
---------------------

Since an Android Activity has its own lifecycle, we should carefully
manage the state of the socket also to avoid problems like memory leaks.
In this app, weâ€™ll close the socket connection and remove all listeners
on ``onDestroy`` callback of Activity.

.. code:: java

   @Override
   public void onDestroy() {
       super.onDestroy();

       mSocket.disconnect();
       mSocket.off("new message", onNewMessage);
   }

Calling ``off()`` removes the listener of the ``new message`` event.

If you want to explore more, I recommend you look into:

-  Other features of this app. They are just implemented with
   ``emit()``, ``on()`` and ``off()``.

-  The details of Socket.IO Java Client. It supports all the features JS
   client does.

-  Many other great Socket.IO implementations created by the community!

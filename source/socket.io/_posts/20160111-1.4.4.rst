Socket.IO 1.4.4
================================


We just published two fixes for ``socket.io-client``:

-  Building with ``browserify`` or ``webpack`` is now completely
   straightforward. No need to ``exclude/ignore`` or
   ``noParse/externals`` the ``ws`` module.

-  Improved the JSONP transport when ``socket.io-client`` or
   ``engine.io-client`` are lazily evaluated or the ``<script>`` tag
   that included them gets removed.

Socket.IO is on Open Collective
====================================

Open Collective provides a transparent, sustainable, and secure way for
people to support and sponsor open source projects. We are joining other
great projects (you may have heard about MochaJS, GulpJS or webpack,
among lots of other awesome projects) in the quest to ensure the
project’s sustainability.

## What is an Open Collective?

From their website:

*An Open Collective is a group of people with a shared mission that
operates in full transparency.*

That allows both individuals and companies to sponsor our mission at
Socket.IO (with potential tax benefits).

What would Socket.IO do with my sponsorship?
--------------------------------------------

That will enable the core contributors to spend more time assuring the
maintenance of the project. That includes:

-  triaging issues and pull requests

-  answering questions on Slack and Stackoverflow (which have been
   somewhat neglected recently)

-  updating the documentation (I think a lot has been done recently, but
   there is still room for improvement!)

Personally I would like to be able to devote a few days a month to the
project (I mean a whole day of work, not a few hours taken here and
there, usually late in the evening).

The goals in the near future:

-  keep the 2.0 version as stable as possible
-  provide a complete documentation
-  add more examples, besides the classic chat

How can I help?
---------------

To become a sponsor or backer, visit our open collective page and follow
the instructions for becoming a part of our collective. Please also take
the time to explore the other awesome collectives that people are
supporting.

And finally, a big thanks to Pia Mancini and her partners for making
this possible.

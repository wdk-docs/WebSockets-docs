Socket.IO 1.4.1, 1.4.2 and 1.4.3
===================================


We published three minor releases right after ``1.4.0`` addressing build
issues in different environments.

-  Socket.IO-client now includes the latest version of engine.io-client

-  Fixed an issue that was preventing bundling with webpack.

-  Socket.IO now adds support for NativeScript!

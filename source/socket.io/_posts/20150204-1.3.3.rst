Socket.IO 1.3.3
================================


Socket.IO **1.3.3** is a backwards-compatible **recommended upgrade**
for everyone.

-  It addresses a bug in the parser that could break the decoder with
   maliciously-crafted binary packets.

-  We now *warn* about errors in the console if you dont manually
   specify an ``error`` event handler for ``Socket`` objects on the
   server.

As usual, you can grab the latest client from the CDN!

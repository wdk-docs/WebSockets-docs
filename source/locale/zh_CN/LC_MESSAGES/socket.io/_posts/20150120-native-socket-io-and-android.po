"``IO.socket()`` returns a socket for ``http://chat.socket.io`` with the "
"default options. Notice that the method caches the result, so you can "
"always get a same ``Socket`` instance for an url from any Activity or "
"Fragment. And we explicitly call ``connect()`` to establish the "
"connection here (unlike the JavaScript client). In this app, we use "
"``onCreate`` lifecycle callback for that, but it actually depends on your"

"notice that inside of ``call()`` is wrapped by "

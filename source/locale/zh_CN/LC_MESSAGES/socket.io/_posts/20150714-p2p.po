"Today were very happy to introduce Socket.IO P2P, the easiest way to "
"establish **a bidirectional events channel between two peers** with a "
"server fallback to provide maximum reliability."

"Socket.IO is used to transport signaling data and as a fallback for "
"clients where the WebRTC ``PeerConnection`` is not supported. Adding a "
"simple piece of middleware to your socket.io setup enables this – no need"
" to hand roll your own signaling exchange or set up, deploy and scale new"
" servers."

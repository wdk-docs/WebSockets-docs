"Socket.IO 1.4.0 ship with new features like **automatic compression** for"

"Compression is enabled by default, as it’s highly beneficial for most "
"application payloads. The following example shows the savings for a "
"realtime stream of tweets."

"The compression gains will vary by transport. For example, WebSocket "
"defaults to a window size of 32kb when **DEFLATE** compression is "
"enabled. Repeated occurrences of strings within that window will be "
"compressed. The following demo (inspired by Julia Evans work) will "
"highlight what the LZ77 algorithm de-duplicates from the traffic sent by "
"the Twitter stream that matches javascript."

"How this demo works: we re-implemented a part of LZ77 in JavaScript. A "
"React component then renders the compressed strings."

"The memory overhead when compression is enabled is not inexistent, "
